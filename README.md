## Abstract
As we consider the impact of material usage on climate change, socially responsible engineers need to create products that use less material without sacrificing performance. Parallel to this, the rising capability of machine learning has allowed it to be a powerful tool to produce effienct structural designs across a variety of objectives. Here is an exploration of a CAD dataset by the GE Jet Engine Bracket design competition. It reflects diverse, realistic and complex designs produced by contestants. The performace of these design across a variety of structural and material efficiency metrics has been quantified by Whalen, Beyene and Mueller in order to further the use of machine learning in application-focused contexts.

## Design Rationale
### Overall visualization concept and goalz
1. Extract design insights the large geometric and 3D structural simulated dataset <br>
2. Discover relationships between shape and structural performance prior to download <br>
3. Explore the geometric variety that exists in the crowdsourced design data

### User Home Page
Upon loading the visualization the user is taken to the home landing page. Becasuse this dataset was one based on academic research vs current events, the home page was designed to give the audience an overview of what this bracket dataset is and how it can be useful. The goal was met through the "CAD and Machine Learning" section on the cover page. The "Start Exploring" section gives users a summary of the two main visualizations they can view and what information and data interactions can be expected from each section. Lastly the title page bar has links to the original design competition where these brackets were created, the published paper that contains information on the computational experiments conducted to get the data shown in the data view visualization, and a link to download the data. This is designed for people who want to learn more inforthat is outside of the scope of the introduction, or want to download and play with the data themselves.

## Overview of Development Process
### Data Exploration and Processing
(Eamon) This work was based on a recently published paper by Whalen et. al. which gave meant alot of the initial data insights, exploration of the dataset and cleaning was done by the authors of that work including Eamon!
