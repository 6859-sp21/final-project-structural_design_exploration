## Design Rationale
### Overall visualization concept and data encoding
One question that was important to our team is the same one that we pose to the users upon visiting our website - Where do ideas come from? Of course there are many ways to answer this question but with respect to our dataset the answers fall on two axes; location and company. Furthermore, due to the global reach of innovation and multinational identity of many companies, a secondary question may be how are these companies producing ideas related and just how far is their intellectual reach. This led us to create an interactive visualization that examines the geospatial distribution of a selection of filed patents from the years 2015 - 2019. 

We used the analogy of bright ideas as patents on the map to bright lights on earth being viewed from space. Each patent is represented by a translucent yellow dot. This means that if there are multiple patents assigned to the same city, or longitude and latitude value, that space will appear darker than an area with only one patent assigned.
