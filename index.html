  <h1>Structural Design Exploration</h1>
  
  <main class="px-3">
    <h2>A closer look at a CAD dataset</h2>
    <p class="lead"> As we start to think about the impact of high material usage on climate change, 
      socially responsible engineers need to create products that use less material but also perform well. 
      Furthermore, the rising capability of machine learning has allowed it to be a powerful tool to produce 
      effienct structural designs across a variety of objectives. Here is an exploration of a CAD data set by the 
      GE Jet Engine Bracket design competition. It reflects diverse, realistic and complex designs produced by contestants. 
      The performace of these design across a variety of structural and material efficiency metrics has been quantified by Whalen, Beyene and Mueller
      in order to further the use of machine learning in application-focused context. 
    </p>

    <p class="lead"> Now the fun starts! You have two ways to explore the data that you can select at a link below.
      Carousel View allows you to view all the brackets by scrolling through page on wheel. Hovering over an image 
      gives you some info on the design of the bracket as well as how that bracket was categorized in the dataset for analysis.
      Data View, allows you to dig in and see how specific brackets perform on interactive plots . Ultimately our goal is to make this 
      dataset accessible to those who are interested, and allow those who are interested in downloading the dataset for their research
      to visualize the data simply, before putting it use.
